## Deployment

### Install MySql
To Run this project you need to install the ***Mysql*** data base and make sure your database is running.
### Configure Nodemailer
To send the email I have used the ***nodemailer*** using google **GMail**  as an service.

You cn check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgcDZl8eXTg) tutorial to get an idea.

### Configure .env file
You also need to create an **.env** file and add the following details

```bash
   PORT = <the port on which you wish to run the service> // any port like 3000 etc
   VERIFY_SECRET = <the jwt token secret for sending email verification> //any string
   LOGIN_SECRET = <the jwt token secret for creating access token after login> // any string
   USER_EMAIL = <the mail that u have configured with nodemailer>
   USER_PASSWORD = <the password that google provided for above mail>
```
### configure config.json for database
You also need to create a ***config.json*** file inside **/src/config**

```bash 
    {
  "development": {
    "username": <username for mysql> //mostly if not changed it is root,
    "password": <your password> //password for the user,
    "database": <name of database>,
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
}

```
### Install all the dependencies

Next from project folder, install all the dependencies
```bash
    npm install
```

### Create the database and perform migrations
navigate to **/src** folder, run the following commands to create the database
```
npx sequelize-cli db:create
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
